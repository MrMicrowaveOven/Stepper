For example, I do not know if the TAG section of the MANAGE page also has it's own subroutine.","id":"5756581ba594a0a8179a9241","pos":950271},"old":{"pos":1310719}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2016-06-28T03:40:33.738Z","memberCreator":{"id":"56e6f558f0f97c2f0fe02ca2","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"James Z","initials":"JZ","username":"jamesz8"}},{"id":"5771f18244800035277d37ff","idMemberCreator":"56e6f558f0f97c2f0fe02ca2","data":{"list":{"name":"DonK - Ideas Backlog","id":"570bd7319c7bf34aa572bc80"},"board":{"shortLink":"wpAqbLPl","name":"Work","id":"56e6fcc3a5cb232251f474bf"},"card":{"shortLink":"qM6kgWAS","idShort":39,"name":"Ideas TASK Table","id":"56f6b70abdaf9c70bf49bca6","pos":215039.5},"old":{"pos":524287}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2016-06-28T03:39:46.326Z","memberCreator":{"id":"56e6f558f0f97c2f0fe02ca2","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"James Z","initials":"JZ","username":"jamesz8"}},{"id":"5771c4540300d99b757006f8","idMemberCreator":"56e6fd05c44d7c5217b95d18","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"wpAqbLPl","name":"Work","id":"56e6fcc3a5cb232251f474bf"},"list":{"name":"DonK - work in progress","id":"570bd82557f3c0f957726d29"},"card":{"shortLink":"Pr2HXnnK","idShort":155,"id":"575e24d2e1e669389a9adaa3"}},"type":"deleteCard","date":"2016-06-28T00:27:00.241Z","memberCreator":{"id":"56e6fd05c44d7c5217b95d18","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Donald Kietzman","initials":"DK","username":"user60208504"}},{"id":"5771c44f5e917b323af1fe53","idMemberCreator":"56e6fd05c44d7c5217b95d18","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"wpAqbLPl","name":"Work","id":"56e6fcc3a5cb232251f474bf"},"list":{"name":"DonK - work in progress","id":"570bd82557f3c0f957726d29"},"card":{"shortLink":"uh9S8Q1e","idShort":157,"id":"575ebcff0932fd9e38ba0d6a"}},"type":"deleteCard","date":"2016-06-28T00:26:55.030Z","memberCreator":{"id":"56e6fd05c44d7c5217b95d18","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Donald Kietzman","initials":"DK","username":"user60208504"}},{"id":"5771a9c2d689fc4f4b3b8e0f","idMemberCreator":"56e6fd05c44d7c5217b95d18","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"wpAqbLPl","name":"Work","id":"56e6fcc3a5cb232251f474bf"},"list":{"name":"DonK - Profit Backlog","id":"570c2be0bb8bef79b126cf1f"},"card":{"shortLink":"UcHpRgkc","idShort":179,"id":"576da006a254d64bb03f00a5"}},"type":"deleteCard","date":"2016-06-27T22:33:38.867Z","memberCreator":{"id":"56e6fd05c44d7c5217b95d18","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Donald Kietzman","initials":"DK","username":"user60208504"}},{"id":"576efbf528bed911b0d8b1bb","idMemberCreator":"56e6fd05c44d7c5217b95d18","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"wpAqbLPl","name":"Work","id":"56e6fcc3a5cb232251f474bf"},"list":{"name":"DonK - work in progress","id":"570bd82557f3c0f957726d29"},"card":{"shortLink":"VFtWiSu0","idShort":175,"id":"576c961a25e5dc3b68cc27a6"}},"type":"deleteCard","date":"2016-06-25T21:47:33.325Z","memberCreator":{"id":"56e6fd05c44d7c5217b95d18","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Donald Kietzman","initials":"DK","username":"user60208504"}},{"id":"576da106eadf3748814ba817","idMemberCreator":"56e6f558f0f97c2f0fe02ca2","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"wpAqbLPl","name":"Work","id":"56e6fcc3a5cb232251f474bf"},"list":{"name":"Trello Don't Likes","id":"56e705585b897bef42ae5c2b"},"card":{"shortLink":"2TubAdXr","idShort":182,"name":"12.
